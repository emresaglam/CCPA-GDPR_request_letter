# CCPA_request_letter

I wanted to have a default letter where I can send to companies where I need to exercise these rights as a California Resident. I start typing one and found myself commiting it to this repo.

Feel free to use this as a baseline, change it to your needs. I feel like it's a solid start and all you can do is make it better.
