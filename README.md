# CCPA and GDPR request letters

I wanted to have a default letter that I can send to companies when I need to exercise these rights as a California Resident. I started typing one and found myself commiting it to this repo.

I also ended up implementing one for GDPR as well. 

Feel free to use this as a baseline, change it to your needs. I feel like it's a solid start and all you can do is make it better. 

# How to use it
Clone the repo. Tailor the letter to your needs. Fields like address, phone number, etc should probably be optional. Fill it the best you can/want. (I usually don't send my address in these letters for example)
