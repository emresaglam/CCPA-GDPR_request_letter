# CCPA and GDPR request letters

I wanted to have a default letter that I can send to companies when I need to exercise these rights as a California Resident. I started typing one and found myself commiting it to this repo.

I also ended up implementing one for GDPR as well. 

Feel free to use this as a baseline, change it to your needs. I feel like it's a solid start and all you can do is make it better.
