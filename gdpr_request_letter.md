According to GDPR Article 17, I have the right to request the erasure of my personal data that your company holds. Therefore, I kindly request that you promptly and securely delete all of my personal data from your records, databases, and any other storage systems. This includes any information that directly or indirectly identifies or relates to me, such as but not limited to my name, address, email, phone number, social security number, and any account or customer identification numbers associated with me.

Please ensure that the erasure is complete and irreversible, and that no backups or copies of my personal data are retained.

This includes any information about the sources from which my personal data was obtained, the purposes for which it was processed, the categories of personal data processed, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom my data has been disclosed.

Please provide this information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and send it to the address mentioned above or to the email address associated with my account, if applicable.

3) Opt-Out of Data Processing:
Under GDPR Article 21, I have the right to object to the processing of my personal data, including any profiling or automated decision-making. Therefore, I hereby request that you cease any further processing of my personal information for any purpose, including but not limited to direct marketing or any other forms of data analysis or profiling.

Please confirm in writing that you have honored my request to opt-out of the processing of my personal data.

I expect a timely response to this request, as required by law. If you have any questions or require additional information to fulfill this request, please contact me at the contact details provided above. I reserve the right to take further legal action if my rights under the GDPR are not upheld.
