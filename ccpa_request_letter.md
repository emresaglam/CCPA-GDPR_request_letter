Subject: Request for Deletion, Access, and Opt-Out of Data Sale

Dear [Company Name],

As a resident of the State of California, I am writing to you to exercise my rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and to request the option to opt-out of the sale of my personal information to any third party, deletion of my personal data, and access to the data you hold about me. Please consider this letter as a formal request, as outlined by the provisions of the CCPA.

1) Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Data:
Pursuant to the CCPA, I request that you immediately cease any sale of my personal information to third parties. Please ensure that my personal information is not shared, sold, or transferred to any external entities for monetary or other valuable consideration. This request is in accordance with the provisions of CCPA Article 15.

2) Deletion of Personal Data:
Under the CCPA Article 12, I have the right to request the deletion of my personal information that your company holds. Therefore, I kindly request that you promptly and securely delete all of my personal data from your records, databases, and any other storage systems. This includes any information that directly or indirectly identifies or relates to me, such as but not limited to my name, address, email, phone number, social security number, and any account or customer identification numbers associated with me.

I understand that there might be certain exceptions where deletion is not required under the CCPA, such as data necessary to complete a transaction, comply with a legal obligation, detect security incidents, exercise free speech, or carry out other legitimate business purposes. However, I request that you delete any data that does not fall within these exceptions.

3) Access to My Data:
In accordance with the CCPA Article 11, I also request access to the specific pieces of personal information that your company has collected, disclosed, or sold about me. This includes any information about the sources from which my personal data was acquired, the purposes for which it was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared.

Please provide this information in a readily usable format and send it to the address mentioned above or to the email address associated with my account, if applicable. I request that you provide this information within 45 days from the receipt of this letter, as mandated by the CCPA.

I expect a timely response to this request, as required by law. If you have any questions or require additional information to fulfill this request, please contact me at the contact details provided above. I reserve the right to take further legal action if my rights under the CCPA are not upheld.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will handle this request promptly and with due consideration.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
